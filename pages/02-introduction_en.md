## Dissatisfaction

<div class="py-8 flex flex-col gap-8">
  <div>
"The trends change too quickly 😵‍💫"

"Another new framework is out. If I don't catch up, I'll be left behind 😢"

"Another vulnerability found in a library. I have to upgrade and test 😮‍💨"

"Major version upgrade brought an unbelievable number of breaking changes 😡"
  </div>
  <div>
"Changed some code, and something else broke without me noticing 😳"

"And there are no tests at all 😱"
  </div>
</div>

## Envy of backend methodologies

<div class="py-4"></div>

- DDD
- Clean Architecture
- Design Patterns
- ...

Why can't we apply these methodologies in frontend...?
