## Summary


The reason frontend is tough is due to excessive dependencies on UI frameworks and state management libraries.

The solution is to separate core logic from peripheral logic.

This improves portability and testability, allowing you to focus on pure programming.

Ideas for separating core and peripheral logic:

- MVVM pattern
  - Place core logic in the ViewModel
  - Place peripheral logic in the View
- Use of DI
  - Separate peripheral logic and inject it into the core logic
